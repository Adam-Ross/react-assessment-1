# Getting started with the assessment

Fork and clone repo and run npm install.

In the project assessment, you will be using a componentDidMount life cycle method to reach out to [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/] to get some users data. 

The data that you get back should be put in state, and rendered to the screen. Much like we did in our workshops with todos. 

Once the users are renderd, each user should be able to be clicked on, and then we should be able to go render a *singleUser* comoponent.

You will also need to have a *Loading* component, and a *Button* component to change the *singleUser* state.

Further instructions will be in scr/app.js

### `npm start`
